/**
 * Expresses an API constraint, such as "API level must be at least 21", or "API level must be 24 or
 * 25" or "API level must be less than 31". This is usually referring to the Android platform API
 * level, but it can also refer to SDK extension API versions.
 *
 * The [ApiConstraint] is used in several contexts:
 * * The `minSdkVersion` of an app is an [ApiConstraint]; for example, `minSdkVersion="31"` in the
 *   manifest is recorded as [Project.getMinSdkVersions] returning an [SdkApiConstraint] of "API
 *   level ≥ 31".
 * * If code performs an explicit `SDK_INT` check, this will be modeled as an [ApiConstraint] by
 *   [VersionChecks]. For example, in the code snippet "SDK_INT < 31 || methodCall()", the version
 *   constraint computed for `methodCall()` will be "API level ≥ 31".
 * * When methods are introduced in later versions of an API, these are also modeled as API
 *   constraints; e.g. a method introduced in API level 32 has the requirement API constraint "API
 *   level ≥ 32".
 *
 * Note that API constraints aren't always simple "X >= Y" relationships. They are modeled as
 * bitvectors, so for example, in the following code:
 * ```
 * when (SDK_INT) {
 *     in 1..14 -> { }
 *     16 -> { }
 *     in 17..20 -> { }
 *     else -> methodCall()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * the [ApiConstraint] computed for the `methodCall` site knows that `SDK_INT` is either 15
 * or >= 21.
 *
 * There are a number of operations defined on [ApiConstraint]s. For example, [isAtLeast] returns
 * true if the receiver API level is at least as high as the parameter API level.
 *
 * In the normal case where you're referring to a simple Android API, this is just an integer
 * comparison -- is manifest minSdkVersion at least as high as the introduced-in API level for the
 * API? But with mainline modules, APIs can be backported and appear in many different SDKs. This is
 * handled by the [ApiConstraint] class as a "vector" of API levels. Both the minSdkVersion and the
 * required API can include multiple API levels, and the [isAtLeast] method checks that the
 * requirements are satisfied.

  /**

   * interface expresses.
   *
   * Put another way, it's because API level vectors are different from simple API levels and will
   * not behave the same symmetric way that an API level would, so we cannot create a consistent
   * ordering (for example an API level vector can contain standalone SDKs which cannot be compared
   * with each other, so there's no sense of one behind "higher" than the other. We would want both
   * x < y and y < x to be false, and there isn't a return value from compareTo we could return that
   * would allow that.)
   *
   * In converting existing API logic using comparator, the following may be helpful:
   * ```
   *   x > y         =>  y < x      => !(y >= x)  => !y.isAtLeast(x)
   *   x < y         =>  !(x >= y)  => !x.isAtLeast(y)
   *   x <= y        =>  y >= x     => y.isAtLeast(x)
   *   x >= y        =>  x.isAtLeast(y) / x.supports(y)
   *   max(x, y) < z => x < z && y < z
   * ```
   *
   * though be careful with if/else handling here due to the incomparable issue mentioned above;
   * just because < is false doesn't mean >= in the else clause will be true.
